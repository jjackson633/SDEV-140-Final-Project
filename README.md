This GUI program is meant to simulate the use of an atm application that you would likely find at any bank. The general function of the application is for an example registered user to log into their account, view their balance, withdraw money from their account, deposit money into their account, and then log out once they are done using the application. Most of the program will be interacted via the same window, with prompt boxes appearing for the user when they want to withdraw or deposit money. See the validation testing section for the users created in advance to demonstrate the use of the program. 
The test users I created for this program, username and passwords are case sensitive:
Username: jjackson633 Password: password1234
Username: sajane22 Password: 321cba
Username: coletaamox Password: discord467
